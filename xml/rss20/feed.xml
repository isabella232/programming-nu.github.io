        <title>Nu-2.1.0</title>
        <description>
        	<p>Nu now includes built in operators for generating HTML and
other XML-style markup.  </p>

<p>For usage examples, see the test/test_markup.nu unit tests.</p>

<p>As a simple example, this Nu code:</p>

<pre><code>(puts (&amp;html (&amp;body (&amp;h1 "Hello!")
                    (&amp;p "This is a test")
                    (&amp;p "This is a second paragraph"))))
</code></pre>

<p>produces the following output:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a test&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You'll note that no line breaks or formatting is included. These can easily be added with xmllint:</p>

<pre><code>%nush sample-markup.nu | xmllint --format -
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a test&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the Nu source formatter (in beautify.nu) now produces prettier output.</p>

        <title>Nu-2.0.1</title>
        <description>
        	<p>This minor update contains better handling of classes whose init
methods return something other than self, notably NSXMLDocument.
It also changes loading of modules to use a single shared parser
so that assignments made in a loaded file are available in the
calling context (as they should have been).</p>

<p>This build was made from the "amalgamated" branch. Soon this branch
will become "master". As with 2.0, this version of Nu is
exclusively for systems running Mac OS 10.7 or iOS 4.3 and 
their successors. </p>

        <title>Nu-2.0.0</title>
        <description>
        	<p>Nu 2.0 is now available through a binary installer. </p>

<p>See the <a href="/downloads">downloads</a> page for this update to Nu.</p>

<p>Nu 2.0 is a simpler, smaller version that uses new
features in iOS 4.3 and Mac OS 10.7 to eliminate external dependencies
and a few internal components.</p>

<ul>
<li>NSRegularExpression replaces PCRE.</li>
<li>imp_implementationWithBlock() is used to generate method implementations.
Previously we used libFFI for this on MacOS and a precompiled pool of
method handlers on iOS. Now this pool is no longer needed.</li>
<li>The NuSymbolTable is now just an NSMutableDictionary.</li>
</ul>

<p>To make it easier to add Nu as a drop-in component of iOS and Mac apps,
the source code has been combined into two files, Nu.h and Nu.m. These
are currently available in the "amalgamated" branch in the git repository,
and will likely be the primary source for Nu going forward.</p>

<p>Nu 2.0 is intended for systems running Mac OS 10.7 or iOS 4.3 and 
their successors. For conciseness and simplicity, support for all 
other platforms is dropped.</p>

        <title>Nu Seems Stable (by Jason Grossman)</title>
        <description>
        	<p>I've been nagging Tim to say something about the stability of recent releases of Nu, so he asked me to write this.  </p>

<p>Nu is a new language (no pun intended - see below for the etymology of the name Nu).  It hasn't yet formed the basis of an impressive suite of stable software, and you'd think hard before using it to write anything mission-critical.</p>

<p>Despite that, it is actually rather stable.  Let me say more about why.</p>

        <title>Nu-0.4.0</title>
        <description>
        	<p>See the <a href="/downloads">downloads</a> page for this long-overdue update to Nu.</p>

<p>The most visible change in this release is that the <strong>macro</strong> operator 
has been switched to refer to <strong>macro-1</strong> 
instead of <strong>macro-0</strong> (the original
Nu macro facility). That is deprecated but kept for compatibility. </p>

<p>Support for garbage collection is now compiled in by default (Mac OS only).</p>

<p>We've also been making good progress running Nu on Linux-based systems.
Currently a few small sites (including Tim's blog)
are running with Nu on Rackspace Cloud Servers. See notes/DEBIANINSTALL in the
Nu source distribution for details about building for Debian.</p>
